⚙️ How It Works

The app uses a JavaScript dictionary that maps each English character (A–Z, 0–9, and some symbols) to its Morse code equivalent.

When the user enters input:

If it’s English text → it gets converted to Morse code.

If it’s Morse code → it gets converted back to English.

📌 Usage

Clone or download the repository.

Start typing in English or Morse code, and see the instant translation!
